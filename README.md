GaPSE (Galaxy Power Spectrum Estimator) is a software for cosmological computations written in the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org).

## Important Remarks

This is a work-in-progress project! As a consequence, currently in this pre-release:
- The monopole (L=0) computations of the Galaxy Number Counts (GNC) correlation functions with `quad` integration and their corresponding Power Spectra (PS) with `:fftlog` have been tested extensively. It is also possible to compute their correlation function multipoles $L=1,2,3,...$  with `:lobatto` integration. However, `:lobatto` still leads to small numerical oscillations, and two terms (Newton-Lensing and Lensing-Newton) converge very slowly (i.e. you must use a high `N_lob` number of points). These problems are nevertheless suppresed when you employ the azymuthally symmetric window function of this code (`use_windows=true`) and consider the power spectrum sum of all these effects;
- you cannot go further than $z \simeq 1.5$;
- The PS computations are by default made with the Julia package [FFTLog](https://github.com/marcobonici/FFTLog.jl). Due to the fact that with `:fftlog` you must specify manually the bias parameter, the Power Spectra computations of a whole group of terms create artificial FFT oscillations in some of them. However, the leading ones and the sum are not affected. The PS code structure gives also the option to implement other routines for this computation, and one with [TwoFAST](https://github.com/hsgg/TwoFAST.jl)[[5]](#1) is sketched (but not yet tested and reliable);
- the code functions are well documented; check the github pages website https://foglienimatteo.github.io/GaPSE.jl/stable if you cannot see correctly the analytical expressions written in the docstrings. The Two-Point Correlation Functions docstrings of the groups `LD`, `GNCxLD` and `LDxGNC` (see below for explanation) are still missing; 
- few people used this code, so bugs are behind the corner; do not hesitate to raise the finger to point them out (see in the [How to report bugs, suggest improvements and/or contribute](#how-to-report-bugs-suggest-improvements-andor-contribute) section below)!
- if you use this code, please read the [Using this code](##using-this-code) section below.

## Brief description

Measurements of the clustering of galaxies in Fourier space, at low wavenumbers, offer a window into the early Universe via the possible presence of scale dependent bias generated by Primordial Non Gaussianities [[1]](#1) [[2]](#1).
On such large scales, a Newtonian treatment of density perturbations might not be sufficient to describe the measurements, and a fully relativistic calculation should be employed.

Given the matter Power Spectrum (PS) at redshift $z=0$ and the background quantities for the Universe considered (both read from [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) outputs), this code can compute:

- all the 16 Two-Point Correlation Functions (TPCFs) arising from the Luminosity Distance (LD) perturbations (see Eq.(2.48) of [[4]](#1)) for an arbitrary multipole order;

- all the 25 TPCFs concerning the relativistic Galaxy Number Counts (GNC)  (see Eq.(2.52) of [[4]](#1)) for an arbitrary multipole order;

- all the 20 cross correlations between GNC and LD (and their 20 counterparts LD cross GNC) for an arbitrary multipole order;

- the PS multipoles of all of them (based on the Yamamoto estimator);

- the Doppler and matter TPCFs in the Plane-Parallel (PP) approximation;

All these calculations can be performed both with and without an azymuthally symmetric window function, that the code allows to compute for a given redshift bin and angular opening.
The multipole computations are tested for $0 \leq L \leq 4$.

This project, and the analytical expressions used for the TPCFs, are based on the paper by Emanuele Castorina and Enea Di Dio [[3]](#1). 

## Installation

Currently, this package is not in the Julia package registries. Assuming that you have already installed a compatible Julia version (1.8.x), the simplest way to install this software is then the following:

- in the terminal, go to the directory where you want to install this package;
  
- clone this repository with Git
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/foglienimatteo/GaPSE.jl
  ```
  or manually download the source code from the url https://github.com/foglienimatteo/GaPSE.jl (Code > Download Zip);

- go inside the directory of GaPSE (`$ cd GaPSE.jl` in the shell).

Inside the directory, there is a file called `install_gapse.jl`, which is a Julia script conceived for downloading and installing all the dependencies of GaPSE. You can run it by typing in the terminal:

```bash
     $ julia install_gapse.jl
```

If there are no error messages at the end of the installation, then GaPSE is corretly configured and you can start to use it!
  


NOTE: instead of using the `install_gapse.jl` script, you can also do the same in a more interactive way, if you prefer:

- open a Julia REPL session and activate the project; you can achieve that opening the REPL with 
  ```bash
  $ julia --activate=.
  ```
  or directy inside the REPL entering the Pkg mode (`]`) and running `activate .`;

- enter the Pkg mode (if you haven't done in the previous step) typing `]` and run `instantiate`; this command will automatically detect and install all the package dependecies (listed in `Project.toml`);

- done! You can exit from the package mode (press the Backspace key on an empty line) and start to use GaPSE.

## Usage

The only mandatory instrument to run the code is a Julia REPL with version 1.8.x . 
There are three ways to use this code:

- you can write whatever instruction inside the file `GaPSE-exe.jl` and then run in the command line
  ```bash
    $ julia GaPSE-exe.jl
  ```

- you can open a Julia REPL session, include the code with
  ```julia
     include("<path-to-GaPSE.jl-directory>/src/GaPSE.jl")
  ```
  and then use interactively the GaPSE functions;

- you can run the same `include("<path-to-GaPSE.jl-directory>/src/GaPSE.jl")` command in a Jupyter Notebook, and use the code functions inside it. This is by far the most confortable way.

Some `.ipynb`s are already provided in the directory `ipynbs` :
- we encourage you to follow the `ipynbs/TUTORIAL.ipynb` file first. The basic structure of the code and the most important functions are there presented;
- `ipynbs/Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.ipynb` explains the analytical Primordial Non-Gaussianities model we use here, computes its contribution in the redshift bin $1.0 \leq z \leq 1.5$ and compares it with the GNC effects, using our azymuthally symmetric window function with angular opening $\theta_{\rm max} = \pi/2$;
- `ipynbs/PS_L01234.ipynb` computes the TPCFs and PS sum of the GNC effects for the multipole orders $L=0,1,2,3,4$, and compares them to the Galaxies Plane-Parallel approximation ones;
- the `ipynbs/Computations_b1p5-sb0-fevo0.jl` and `ipynbs/PS_L01234.jl` Julia files are the translation into scripts of the correspinding ipynbs; you can run them from the command line with:
  ```bash
    $ julia <scriptname.jl>
  ```
  The other scripts`ipynbs/PS_L01234_pt0.jl`, ..., `ipynbs/PS_L01234_pt0.jl` allow you to speed up the `ipynbs/PS_L01234.jl` computations, running them in different terminals.

The code is well tested and documented: almost each struct/function has a docstring that you can easily access in Julia with `?<name-of-the-struct/function>`, and there is an active GitHub Pages website with the [latest stable documentation](https://foglienimatteo.github.io/GaPSE/stable).
